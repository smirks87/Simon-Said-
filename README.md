# Simon-Said-

my first solo project

Simon Said is a game of memory on color patterns and it will test your memory as you progress through the levels the pattern of colors become longer. there are 4 colored squares and when the player presses the start button it will initialize a random color selection. if the player guesses the right pattern you move to the next level.

As the levels increase so does the length of the patterns, every new level adds a different color chosen at random that the user must remember and enter the proper sequence of colors to advance to the next level.

If the player happens to forget the pattern it will say Game over and the computer will ask would you like to retry prompting a retry button. If the player decides to retry a start button will pop up and the levels will start all over again .

If the players memory is great and they are able to pass all the levels, a winner screen will pop up saying congratulations!! you have an excellent memory and Brett was not able beat you!! prompting a retry button if the player decides to give it another go and a no thanks button if the player has had enough and when this button is pressed it will say thanks for playing
